# Organize Large Collection of Downloadable Packages
Break up a set of packages into a set of downloadable .tar.gz files. When you want to create a large download of say open source packages for redistribution - such that no download file is bigger than a certain size (e.g., 1 GB). That is, based on a specific max size this utility will determine how to organize a large collection of archived packages in to a collection of reasonably size set of downloadable .tar.gz archives. For example, say you have 500 packages to make downloadable on a website. Instead of individually publishing 500 this utility will group them in to a smaller number of .tar.gz download files (e.g., 500 -> 5 each totaling  no larger than 1G â€“ or whatever maximum you choose).
